# Differentiable Safe Controller Design through Control Barrier Functions

Paper is available [online](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10004041).

The implementation has been tested in Google Colab.

# Reproduce the Results
To reproduce two case studies in the paper, please go to two folders (`adaptive-cruise-control` and `aircrafts-collision-avoidance`) and run the included notebook files respectively.
The trained models are saved in `Models` folder.

# Next steps
To implement a general framework instead of just case-specifics.
